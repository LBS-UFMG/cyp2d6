# CYP2D6 functional status predictor

Supplementary material for the article "Using machine learning and graph-based signatures to evaluate normal and decreased function CYP2D6 alleles"

Classes evaluated:
- Decreased function
- Normal function 


## Directories

- **/data** - Contains sequence data in fasta format, as well as structures modeled using ColabFold. Additionally, input tables are available in the input.xlsx file.

- **/machine_learning** - Contains files with models built using the Orange Data Mining tool. Structural signatures can be obtained in the structure_input.csv file. The table with SNPs used in sequence-based models can be obtained in the sequence_input.tsv file.
